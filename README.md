## Game Pitch 
#### Game Title 
"Magical Kissa and the MetaQuant Invasion"
#### Genre 
Side-scrolling platformer. 
#### Target 
From the age of 11 to 15 years old.
#### Synopsis 
Kissa is 15 years old and a wannabe painter and art student, who gets teleported into a quantum computer. There, the hologram of a scientist, who is her spitting image, tells her that an alien race invaded Earth in her dimension: the MetaQuant, able to decompose and split themselves into particles, this way travelling through space. Doctor Saski (that is her name) used her own creation, the quantum computer, to trap the aliens inside: she's giving Kissa magical powers to defeat the MetaQuant before they get out of there and destroy Earth. 
Before dying, Saski locked the leader of the MetaQuant in a box inside the quantum computer: Kissa will need to gain strength and ability in her journey to reach the box and save the world. 
##### Characters 
- **Kissa** - ***player character***
- Saski - *non-player character, she interacts with Kissa through dialogues in key moments of the story*
- MetaQuant - *enemies*
- MetaQuant Leader - *final boss*
##### World 
The interior of a quantum computer.
#### Art
2D Pixel art (32x32).
##### Environment 
Resembles the aesthetics of a quantum computer: tubes, long spirals, gold and silvery vertical wires from where platforms hang; plus, some flashing light runs on the background through the tubes. On Level 1, the environment is bright, but it gets darker and darker each Level.

##### Main Character 
Long, wavy and brown hair; purple eyes with feline shaped pupils. 
She wears headphones with robotic cat ears on the top; on the left side, however, the earbud is gone and there's only a microphone.
Light skin, she has scars on the left side of her body and her left cat ear is broken.  
Costume: sleeveless white gown (similar to those used by scientists), tightened by a corset; heart-shaped top and flounce miniskirt, asymmetrical as it gets longer on the left leg, while it reveals lining shorts under it on the right side; she wears a single parisian sock on her right leg and short boots. 
Colourful, colours contrasting the background.

##### Kissa's Quarterstaff 
Magical quarterstaff which holds Kissa's and Saski's essence: it has one big brush on one side (that used to attack), and this symbol:

on the other (used to measure MetaQuant)
##### MetaQuant 
Draft: https://www.piskelapp.com/p/agxzfnBpc2tlbC1hcHByEwsSBlBpc2tlbBiAgOCk35j8Cww/view 
Best way to describe them is: between UFOs (since they have an elliptical shape, and their paws rotate as the lights on the bottom of the typical UFO), "emojis" (since their expressions are one of the most apparent features distinguishing one twin from the other, along with the colours, and at the same time represent the kind of skills they have), and their general stylized shapes are similar to the aliens from Space Invaders. 
##### Games to take inspiration from: 
- _Sword of Mana_: the main characters' expressiveness, pixel art.
#### Gameplay 
The mechanics are inspired upon quantum superposition and entanglement: for this reason, one alien is composed by two twins as superposition is explained as two opposed statuses of the same quantum. The MetaQuant simulate the particles' behaviour, in an increasing difficulty as the player moves forward.
Once entanglement is introduced as an additional mechanic, Kissa is able to increase and build her powers according to the typology of MetaQuant twin she's "entangled" with: this will change the MQ Leader fight skills depending on the alien who's not been linked to the player. 
Four levels.
Single Player, narrative storyline. 
#### Platform 
PC
#### Engine 
Unity
